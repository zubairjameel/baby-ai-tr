# Baby AI

**A 3D Neural Interface that turns the "Black Box" of AI into a transparent, navigable mind.**

## 🧠 The Vision

What if you could **watch an AI learn**? What if every thought, every connection, every piece of knowledge was visible in real-time as a living, breathing neural network?

**Baby AI** is an experiment in **transparent artificial intelligence**. It's not just a chatbot—it's a window into how AI thinks, learns, and grows from zero knowledge.

### The Core Concept

Most AI systems are **black boxes**—you ask a question, you get an answer, but you have no idea what's happening inside. Baby AI flips this paradigm:

- **Every conversation teaches the AI** - It starts with a *simulated* blank slate (enforced by prompts, not true zero-data)
- **Every concept becomes a neuron** - Knowledge is spatially mapped to anatomically-correct brain regions
- **Every connection is visible** - Watch synapses form as the AI links ideas together
- **Every thought lights up** - See neural pathways activate in real-time as the AI processes information

This isn't just visualization—it's **cognitive transparency**. You're not just using an AI; you're **raising one**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Spatial Knowledge Mapping
- Concepts are placed in **anatomically-correct brain regions** (visual cortex, language areas, logic centers)
- Knowledge grows organically as you teach the AI
- Navigate the 3D brain to explore what the AI knows

### 🔗 Real-Time Neural Connections
- Watch **synapses form** as the AI links related concepts
- See the **strength of connections** grow with repeated use
- Observe **signal propagation** when the AI processes queries

### 🌌 Holographic Brain Visualization
- Stunning **3D particle-based brain** with cyan-to-magenta gradient
- Smooth camera controls and interactive exploration
- Anatomically-inspired structure (frontal lobe, cerebellum, brain stem)

### 💬 Minimal Black Glassmorphism UI
- Ultra-clean floating chat interface
- Pure black glassmorphism design
- Doesn't interfere with the brain visualization

### 🤖 Powered by Gemini 3 Flash Preview
- Uses Google's latest **Gemini 3 Flash Preview** model
- Fast, accurate knowledge extraction
- JSON-structured responses for precise neural mapping

## 🎬 The Experience

1. **Start with an empty brain** - The AI knows nothing
2. **Teach it anything** - "The sky is blue", "Paris is in France", "2+2=4"
3. **Watch neurons form** - See concepts appear as glowing nodes in the brain
4. **Ask questions** - The AI recalls what you taught it
5. **See it think** - Watch neural signals travel through the brain as it processes your query

## 🎯 Future Vision

This is just the beginning. The long-term vision is to **embody this AI in a physical robot**—a machine that learns like a child, with a transparent mind you can literally see growing.

Imagine:
- A robot that learns from scratch by interacting with the world
- A holographic display showing its neural network in real-time
- The ability to "debug" AI behavior by watching its thought process
- True human-AI collaboration through cognitive transparency

**Baby AI** is a proof-of-concept for this future—where AI isn't a mysterious oracle, but a partner whose mind you can understand.
